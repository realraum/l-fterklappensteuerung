1. sanchez noted, that the laminaflow damper would sometimes move when the light was turned on or off.
2. Used this opportunity to disconnect the long 5V line between the µC and add a second 12V->5V DC/DC Buck Converter which supplys the Lamina/Laser µC and RaspberryPi from 12V
3. had some problems with defective USB-cable contact
4. problem remains
5. further observation shows that µC does _not_ reboot, but ruther believes that the dumper is in the 0-position
6. seems that the ceiling light, actually triggers the IR-forked light barrier endstop.
7. tried to naively shield endstop against external light, however no real improvement was achieved
8. changed firmware to only accept endstop triggers when the motor is moving, but problems still can happen when someone turns on/off the light while the motor is moving


Status:
- usb cable still has defective contact but no equally long cable is at hand. Currently works if not moved.
- firmware change is effective, damper works well and does not move anymore when light is changed
- stand-alone 5V generation seems to improve EMI suspectibility (no more long 5V/GND loop)
- big C's are staying disconnected
