1. sanchez noted, that the laminaflow damper would sometimes move when the light was turned on or off.
2. Used this opportunity to disconnect the long 5V line between the µC and add a second 12V->5V DC/DC Buck Converter which supplys the Lamina/Laser µC and RaspberryPi from 12V
3. had some problems with defective USB-cable contact
4. problem remains
5. further observation shows that µC does _not_ reboot, but ruther believes that the dumper is in the 0-position
6. seems that the ceiling light, actually triggers the IR-forked light barrier endstop.
